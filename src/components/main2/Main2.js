                        <p>Hiring camping equipment is much cheaper than buying everything, with prices starting from just £70. This saves you the hassle and hazard of storing your camping equipment and tent in between trips, where it may become damaged in an attic or a cramped garage space.</p>

                        <p>Budget equipment doesn't last, and ends up being thrown away. This method enables you to share and reuse gear, and have a better camping experience overall. There’s nothing worse than having shoddy gear, and only finding this out when you’re stuck in stormy weather on a hillside. With our camping equipment hire in the New Forest, this will not happen.</p>
